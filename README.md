# Data Analysis personal projects

These are projects that i've done to show off that I am knowledgeable in some of the programs that are needed in a Junior / Entry Level / Associate analyst role.
I tried to make them varied in the questions I am trying to answer and the industries I am analyzing, in order to broaden my view in what roles I Would be good in.

#Programs I am trying to demonstrate
MySQL
Tableau Public
Excel / Google Sheets
Python - (Basics)
