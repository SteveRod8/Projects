The import process was fairly annoying. You have to first delete the full address column and PIM link column.
I was also considering removing more data such as, building name, building address (part 2), and removing data that had too many null values in important areas, such as 
the floor area.
However, in investigating the floor area, I noticed that they are all upcoming, cannabis businesses, and I believe bias would start to form if I excluded them.
I decided that before I start removing too many columns, I would look at in mysql workbench.
