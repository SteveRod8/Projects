I wanted to undertake a problem that shows off that I can do market research, the data that I found through Kaggle, user Jack Daoud,
shows off very interesting statistics in terms of marketing campaign effectiveness, revenue gained, responses to surveys, and much
more data that can be used for EDA analysis.

The first thing one must do is to attempt and get an understanding of the all the variable names and how they could have a relationship with each other.
Immediately looking, the amount spent on different items was eye catching, and one of the first thing I want to examine and visualize is how they compare.
Before that though, I would like to outline some of the bigger questions I will be answering. I believe;
Was the advertising campaign effective? and a Exploratory data analysis of items sold and what type they are for the future
is what I will be focusing on.

First thing first is to see what empty values, sensitive data, or uneeded attributes are present. 
I noticed right away that some income values were not reported, so I decided to get rid of them, as to not drastically change our averages.
I was considering combining some of the values of the education level attribute, however, since I wasn't able to find confirmation of what those different names were, I couldn't.
