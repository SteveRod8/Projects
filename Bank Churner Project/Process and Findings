Data Preparation Phase:
In excel, I wanted to make sure that the data made sense, before I imported it into mysql.
As the original owner of the data suggests, I did decide to delete the last two columns that he had, since it didn't make much sense to keep.
I was considering removing more data pooints, such as the total_relationship_count and contact_count, as they are not really explained in the data set of what they represent,
however, I decided to keep it in, because it would be easier to keep it in and figure out how they could be useuful, instead of adding them on later if they ended up being crucial to analysis.
After importing the data set, I decided to quickly check that I have the values lining up correctly, so I ran a couple of table discriptive queries for an easy look.
It was also done to make sure I got all 10,000+ rows.

Exploration / Processing Phase:
Some quick easy analysis can be found from sample statistics of our bank account owners. I ran some standard queries and then some more complext queries to show that I 
know how to do both methods, and to show that in the slightly more complex method, I am able to be more descriptive and clear in the numbers I am pulling.
                   Avg Age             Avg Months on book        Avg months of account inactivity 
Attrited Customer: 46.6595             36.1782                   2.6933
Existing Customer: 46.2621             35.8806                   2.2738

Without running a sig test (Which I will do eventually), it is impossible to see if these figures are statistically significant in detemining if age, months on book, or account inactivity
have any effect on customer churning. 

I wanted to test our my count(*) knowledge, so I did a complex query to see what the breakdown of each category of customer looks like, by marital status. 
                    total       Married_Count   Single_Count      Divorced_Count        Unknown_Count
Attrited customer:  1627        709             668               121                   129
Then a simple, but less descriptive query, with no customer alias' or a total 
Existing customer:              3978            3275              627                   620

I wanted more insights, but now with percentages, in order to roundout the counts to make it easier to digest. 
Attrited Customer:
Education Level       Count(*)      Percent
Graduate              487           29.93
Doctorate             95            5.83
Unknown               256           15.73
High School           306           18.80
College               154           9.46
Uneducated            237           14.56
Post-Graduate         92            5.65

Existing Customer:
Education_Level     # of People     Percent
High School         1707            20.08235
Graduate            2641            31.07059
Uneducated          1250            14.70588
Unknown             1263            14.85882
College             859             10.10588
Post-Graduate       424             4.98824
Doctorate           356             4.18824

I decide to then use Tableau to visualize some other the other data that would be difficult to explain or understand by looking at just the numbers.
Here is the box and whisker plot of the average utilization ratio of the customer, seperated by attrition_flag (Existing vs Attrited).

Continuing my Tableau experience, I decided to create more tables for it to gather more information.
I wanted to see how dependents played a role in attrited vs existing customers, however, as the data was, I found it difficult to visualize it cleanly. I went back to mysql to 
create a quick and small table that I could recreate in excel, in order to import it back to tableau. A simple process, but oculd be time consuming if one didn't already learn some of the 
neat tricks I have demonstrated throughout this project so far. 

Attrition_Flag	      Dependent_count	COUNT(*)	Attrired Percent	Existing Percent
Attrited Customer	    0	              135	      8.29748	          1.58824
Attrited Customer	    1	              269	      16.53350	        3.16471
Attrited Customer	    2	              417	      25.62999	        4.90588
Attrited Customer	    3	              482	      29.62508	        5.67059
Attrited Customer	    4	              260	      15.98033	        3.05882
Attrited Customer	    5	              64	      3.93362	        0.75294
Existing Customer	    0	              769	      47.26490	        9.04706
Existing Customer	    1	              1569	      96.43516	        18.45882
Existing Customer	    2	              2238	      137.55378	        26.32941
Existing Customer	    3	              2250	      138.29133	        26.47059
Existing Customer	    4	              1314	      80.76214	        15.45882
Existing Customer	    5	              360	      22.12661	        4.23529

It by no means looks pretty, and as you can tell, the percents don't make sense if it doesn't belong to the correct category, but I simply needed a quick easy table so I could 
recreate it in an Excel sheet, and this provides all the information I need.

This is the resulting picture




This is a very basic analysis, in order to show that I do have knowledge of key tools, formulas, and software needed in a real working enviornment.
